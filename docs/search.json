We have these values in the data: 175.4, 154.6, 117.6. In the function we use fd$intake to programmatically extract the values.\n\nfd$intake\n\n[1] 175.4 154.6 117.6\n\n# define objective \nobjective <- function(x)\n{\n  return ( (x[1]- fd$intake[1])^2 + \n             (x[2]- fd$intake[2])^2 + \n             (x[3]- fd$intake[3])^2)\n}\n\n\n\nConstraints\nNow we define the inequality constraints. For this demo, we only include 3 metrics (energy, protein, ghge) for simplicity.\n\n# select the metrics we want to keep \nc3 <- c3foods[, c('energy', 'protein', 'ghge')]\nc3\n\n      energy  protein    ghge\nlwr 2789.142 34.76268 1.67292\nupr 3099.047 38.62520 1.85880\n\n\nThe inequality constraints need to be reformulated for nloptr to work. More specifically, nloptr optimizes a function \\(f(x)\\) subject to a set of equality and inequality constraints. For the inequality constraints, they need to be the form of \\(g(x) <= 0\\).\nWe write out our own constraints for energy:\n\\(x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 >= E_{lower}, x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 <= E_{upper}\\)\nThese two need to be re-written to be in the format of \\(g(x) <= 0\\).\n\\(-(x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3)+E_{lower} <= 0\\)\n\\(x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 - E_{upper} <= 0\\)\nThe constraints for protein, ghge can be written in similar ways.\n\n# define the inequality constraints\ninequalconstr <- function (x) {\n  constr <- c(\n    # energy\n    - x[1]*fd$energy[1] - x[2]*fd$energy[2] - x[3]*fd$energy[3] + c3$energy[1], # lower\n    x[1]*fd$energy[1] + x[2]*fd$energy[2] + x[3]*fd$energy[3] - c3$energy[2], # upper\n    \n    # protein\n    - x[1]*fd$protein[1] - x[2]*fd$protein[2] - x[3]*fd$protein[3] + c3$protein[1],\n    x[1]*fd$protein[1] + x[2]*fd$protein[2] + x[3]*fd$protein[3] - c3$protein[2],\n\n    # ghge\n    - x[1]*fd$ghge[1] - x[2]*fd$ghge[2] - x[3]*fd$ghge[3]+ c3$ghge[1],\n    x[1]*fd$ghge[1] + x[2]*fd$ghge[2] + x[3]*fd$ghge[3] - c3$ghge[2]\n  )\n  return (constr)\n}\n\n\n\nOther options\nWe do not need to explicitly specify the non-negativity constraints for \\(x\\) inside the function. They are specified outside the function as a set of lower and upper bounds. You can set these range to be anything that make sense; for now we make it close to the current diet.\nInitial values are the values you tell the program to start the search. This is also up to you; sometimes initial values can have a large impact on the final results when the optimization problem is difficult (e.g. has multiple local optima). We can start close to the values of the current diet.\n\n# lower and upper bounds of x (3 foods)\nlb <- c(160, 140, 100)\nub <- c(180, 160, 120)\n\n# Initial values\n# (try different ones!)\nx0 <- c(175, 150, 110) \n\nOptions should also be supplied to the program as a named list. These are specifications for the algorithm, tolerance and maximum evaluation. For more details please check the function manual.\nPay attention to the last line here: the size inside rep() need to match the number of inequality constraints. In this example it should be 6.\n\nopts <- list( \"algorithm\" = \"NLOPT_GN_ISRES\",\n              \"xtol_rel\"= 1.0e-15,\n              \"maxeval\"= 160000,\n              \"tol_constraints_ineq\" = rep( 1.0e-10, 6 ))\n\nNow we run the optimization by calling nloptr from nloptr package. If you have loaded the package before, you don’t need the :: between the two.\nWe print the result and check the optimized values.\n\n# run the algorithm\nres <- nloptr::nloptr(\n  x0          = x0,        # initial value for x\n  eval_f      = objective, # objective function\n  lb          = lb,        # lower bound for x\n  ub          = ub,        # upper bound for x\n  eval_g_ineq = inequalconstr, # inequality constraint\n  opts        = opts       # options\n  )\n\nprint(res)\n\n\nCall:\nnloptr::nloptr(x0 = x0, eval_f = objective, lb = lb, ub = ub, \n    eval_g_ineq = inequalconstr, opts = opts)\n\n\nMinimization using NLopt version 2.7.1 \n\nNLopt solver status: 4 ( NLOPT_XTOL_REACHED: Optimization stopped because \nxtol_rel or xtol_abs (above) was reached. )\n\nNumber of Iterations....: 35522 \nTermination conditions:  xtol_rel: 1e-15    maxeval: 160000 \nNumber of inequality constraints:  6 \nNumber of equality constraints:    0 \nOptimal value of objective function:  9.22904150236166e-26 \nOptimal value of controls: 175.4 154.6 117.6\n\n\nThe optimal values are 175.4, 154.6, 117.6. These are the same as the current diet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis result is not surprising; our current diet on the three foods already satisfies the constraints, and it is the closest to the current diet (\\((x_1 - X_1)^2 +(x_2 - X_2)^2 + (x_3 - X_3)^2 = 0\\)) when \\(x_1 = X_1, x_2 = X_2, x_3 = X_3\\)."

For example,\n\nthe contribution of energy per food becomes (2.25, 0.33, 1.76) rather than (10.69, 1.56, 8.34)\nthe contribution of ghge per food becomes (0.14, 0.14, 1.87) rather than (0.001, 0.001, 0.013)\n\nSimilarly, the upper and lower limit of the constraints also need to be re-scaled. After rescaling, the target will be on a range of hundreds, rather than 3000 vs 1.8.\n\n# find sd for each category: energy, protein.. ghge\n# divide by these coef\ncontrib_pergram <- contrib_pergram[, c('energy', 'protein', 'fat', 'carbs', 'ghge')]\ncontrib_pergram\n\n   energy protein   fat carbs  ghge\n1: 10.696   0.091 0.030 0.441 0.001\n2:  1.565   0.015 0.008 0.050 0.001\n3:  8.342   0.173 0.139 0.014 0.013\n\nsd_coef <- apply(contrib_pergram, MARGIN = 2, sd)\n\ncontrib_pergram_std <- sweep(contrib_pergram, MARGIN = 2, 1/sd_coef, FUN = '*')\ncontrib_pergram_std\n\n     energy   protein       fat     carbs      ghge\n1 2.2562170 1.1516220 0.4276560 1.8621635 0.1443376\n2 0.3301215 0.1898278 0.1140416 0.2111296 0.1443376\n3 1.7596637 2.1893473 1.9814728 0.0591163 1.8763884\n\n# standardize constraint\n# test the previous constraint\nconst_lwrupr\n\n     energy  protein      fat    carbs    ghge\n1: 2789.142 34.76268 20.56068 78.05502 1.67292\n2: 3099.047 38.62520 22.84520 86.72780 1.85880\n\nconst_lwrupr_std <- sweep(const_lwrupr, MARGIN = 2, 1/sd_coef, FUN = '*')\nconst_lwrupr_std\n\n    energy  protein      fat    carbs     ghge\n1 588.3423 439.9282 293.0966 329.5946 241.4652\n2 653.7137 488.8091 325.6629 366.2162 268.2947\n\n\nIn the future, different scaling factor can be applied; but it should be a positive number after scaling.

    "text": "How are constaints computed\n\nThe total contribution of a diet is a weighted sum of all food intake (diet, in gram) and contribution to this particular nutrition / environment impact outcome (tag_outcome). For instance, in total, the current diet of 188g bread and 165g red meat contributes to X1 units of energy; X2 units of ghge.\nThe current diet is the average for each food group among all subjects who we collected data from. The lwr, upr of the current are used to limit the search region for the new diet. In the current implementation, they are 5% and 95% quantiles from all the subject.\nThe inequality constraints (e.g. energy) requires two values: constr_min, constr_max. This means that the computed total contribution of the new diet need to be between these two. In the current implementation:\n\nminimum (lower bound) is 0.9 times of the total contribution\nmaximum (upper bound) is the same of the total contribution\nif we want to reduce ghge, then multiply a factor to the two values above.\n\nIn addition to the raw values, we also implement a standardized version for each of the tag_outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRationale for standardization\n\n\n\nWe wish to have roughly the same scale for different tag_outcomes. The current implementation takes the standard deviation across all foods for a specific tag (e.g. energy), then divide by this value. This is only ONE of the many ways to standardize for numerical stability.\nAlternatively, it is also possible to multiply a fixed constant such as 1000 to ghge. The interpretation could be better. As long the original diet vector is intact (meaning that the ratio between the original food 1, food 2 are unchanged), one can artificially modify the coefficients as they wish.\nHowever, it is important to keep consistency in the values and the inequality function!\n\n\n\ndemo_input &lt;- readRDS('data/demo_9foods_input.rda')\ndemo_input$current_diet\n\n       food_name intake_mean intake_lwr intake_upr\n1          Bread   188.31866  18.831866      343.8\n2     Vegetables    72.79364   7.279364      230.7\n3       Red meat   165.98669  16.598669      419.7\n4  Milk, yoghurt   184.13142  18.413142      552.7\n5           Fish   126.26154  12.626154      299.6\n6         Cheese    74.61885   7.461885      302.9\n7           Eggs    26.41185   2.641185      111.6\n8 Fruit, berries   328.64505  32.864505      900.6\n9       Potatoes    46.59652   4.659652      121.6\n\n\n\ndemo_input$unit_contrib\n\n       food_name    energy     protein       carbs         fat    vitaminc\n1          Bread 10.695553 0.091220068 0.441277081 0.030216648 0.005701254\n2     Vegetables  3.790560 0.020648968 0.178466077 0.007374631 0.132743363\n3       Red meat  1.565330 0.014877102 0.049805951 0.008408797 0.206985770\n4  Milk, yoghurt  2.728863 0.007580175 0.134110787 0.004081633 0.198250729\n5           Fish  8.341837 0.172619048 0.013605442 0.139455782 0.042517007\n6         Cheese  6.086331 0.169784173 0.024460432 0.074820144 0.000000000\n7           Eggs  6.178862 0.130081301 0.004065041 0.105691057 0.000000000\n8 Fruit, berries  1.979745 0.035935969 0.055864097 0.011107481 0.000000000\n9       Potatoes 13.502304 0.216589862 0.048387097 0.241935484 0.000000000\n     calcium    ghge\n1 0.33637400 0.00107\n2 0.08849558 0.00037\n3 0.25873221 0.00103\n4 0.15160350 0.00072\n5 0.11054422 0.01294\n6 0.24460432 0.00311\n7 0.52845529 0.00215\n8 1.28062725 0.00143\n9 6.58986175 0.01030\n\n\n\ndemo_constraints &lt;- readRDS('data/demo_9foods_constraints.rda')\ndemo_constraints\n\n  tag_outcome total_contrib_raw total_contrib_std    std_coef constr_min_std\n1      energy       6002.791497         1460.2828   0.2432673      1314.2545\n2     protein         82.349152         1034.1940  12.5586475       930.7746\n3       carbs        153.317587         1108.5790   7.2306054       997.7211\n4         fat         49.280653          606.6639  12.3103864       545.9975\n5    vitaminc         86.965858          976.6934  11.2307682       879.0241\n6     calcium        914.751986          434.7877   0.4753067       391.3090\n7        ghge          3.404557          736.7069 216.3885105       663.0362\n  cosntr_max_std constr_min_raw constr_max_raw\n1      1460.2828    5402.512347    6002.791497\n2      1034.1940      74.114237      82.349152\n3      1108.5790     137.985828     153.317587\n4       606.6639      44.352588      49.280653\n5       976.6934      78.269272      86.965858\n6       434.7877     823.276788     914.751986\n7       736.7069       3.064101       3.404557"

We have these values in the data: 175.4, 154.6, 117.6.

For this demo, we only include 3 metrics (energy, protein, ghge) for simplicity.\n\n# select the metrics we want to keep \nc3 &lt;- c3foods[, c('energy', 'protein', 'ghge')]\nc3\n\n      energy  protein    ghge\nlwr 2789.142 34.76268 1.67292\nupr 3099.047 38.62520 1.85880\n\n\nThe inequality constraints need to be reformulated for nloptr to work. More specifically, nloptr optimizes a function \\(f(x)\\) subject to a set of equality and inequality constraints. For the inequality constraints, they need to be the form of \\(g(x) &lt;= 0\\).\nWe write out our own constraints for energy:\n\\(x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 &gt;= E_{lower}, x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 &lt;= E_{upper}\\)\nThese two need to be re-written to be in the format of \\(g(x) &lt;= 0\\).\n\\(-(x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3)+E_{lower} &lt;= 0\\)\n\\(x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 - E_{upper} &lt;= 0\\)\nThe constraints for protein, ghge can be written in similar ways.\n\n# define the inequality constraints\ninequalconstr &lt;- function (x) {\n  constr &lt;- c(\n    # energy\n    - x[1]*fd$energy[1] - x[2]*fd$energy[2] - x[3]*fd$energy[3] + c3$energy[1], # lower\n    x[1]*fd$energy[1] + x[2]*fd$energy[2] + x[3]*fd$energy[3] - c3$energy[2], # upper\n    \n    # protein\n    - x[1]*fd$protein[1] - x[2]*fd$protein[2] - x[3]*fd$protein[3] + c3$protein[1],\n    x[1]*fd$protein[1] + x[2]*fd$protein[2] + x[3]*fd$protein[3] - c3$protein[2],\n\n    # ghge\n    - x[1]*fd$ghge[1] - x[2]*fd$ghge[2] - x[3]*fd$ghge[3]+ c3$ghge[1],\n    x[1]*fd$ghge[1] + x[2]*fd$ghge[2] + x[3]*fd$ghge[3] - c3$ghge[2]\n  )\n  return (constr)\n}\n\n\n\nOther options\nWe do not need to explicitly specify the non-negativity constraints for \\(x\\) inside the function. They are specified outside the function as a set of lower and upper bounds. You can set these range to be anything that make sense; for now we make it close to the current diet.\nInitial values are the values you tell the program to start the search. This is also up to you; sometimes initial values can have a large impact on the final results when the optimization problem is difficult (e.g. has multiple local optima). We can start close to the values of the current diet.\n\n# lower and upper bounds of x (3 foods)\nlb &lt;- c(160, 140, 100)\nub &lt;- c(180, 160, 120)\n\n# Initial values\n# (try different ones!)\nx0 &lt;- c(175, 150, 110) \n\nOptions should also be supplied to the program as a named list. These are specifications for the algorithm, tolerance and maximum evaluation. For more details please check the function manual.\nPay attention to the last line here: the size inside rep() need to match the number of inequality constraints. In this example it should be 6.\n\nopts &lt;- list( \"algorithm\" = \"NLOPT_GN_ISRES\",\n              \"xtol_rel\"= 1.0e-15,\n              \"maxeval\"= 160000,\n              \"tol_constraints_ineq\" = rep( 1.0e-10, 6 ))\n\nNow we run the optimization by calling nloptr from nloptr package. If you have loaded the package before, you don’t need the :: between the two.\nWe print the result and check the optimized values.\n\n# run the algorithm\nres &lt;- nloptr::nloptr(\n  x0          = x0,        # initial value for x\n  eval_f      = objective, # objective function\n  lb          = lb,        # lower bound for x\n  ub          = ub,        # upper bound for x\n  eval_g_ineq = inequalconstr, # inequality constraint\n  opts        = opts       # options\n  )\n\nprint(res)\n\n\nCall:\nnloptr::nloptr(x0 = x0, eval_f = objective, lb = lb, ub = ub, \n    eval_g_ineq = inequalconstr, opts = opts)\n\n\nMinimization using NLopt version 2.7.1 \n\nNLopt solver status: 4 ( NLOPT_XTOL_REACHED: Optimization stopped because \nxtol_rel or xtol_abs (above) was reached. )\n\nNumber of Iterations....: 36023 \nTermination conditions:  xtol_rel: 1e-15    maxeval: 160000 \nNumber of inequality constraints:  6 \nNumber of equality constraints:    0 \nOptimal value of objective function:  8.01735115194219e-26 \nOptimal value of controls: 175.4 154.6 117.6\n\n\nThe optimal values are 175.4, 154.6, 117.6. These are the same as the current diet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis result is not surprising; our current diet on the three foods already satisfies the constraints, and it is the closest to the current diet (\\((x_1 - X_1)^2 +(x_2 - X_2)^2 + (x_3 - X_3)^2 = 0\\)) when \\(x_1 = X_1, x_2 = X_2, x_3 = X_3\\)."

    "text": "How are constaints computed\n\nThe total contribution of a diet is a weighted sum of all food intake (diet, in gram) and contribution to this particular nutrition / environment impact outcome (tag_outcome). For instance, in total, the current diet of 188g bread and 165g red meat contributes to X1 units of energy; X2 units of ghge.\nThe current diet is the average for each food group among all subjects who we collected data from. The lwr, upr of the current are used to limit the search region for the new diet. In the current implementation, they are 5% and 95% quantiles from all the subject.\nThe inequality constraints (e.g. energy) requires two values: constr_min, constr_max. This means that the computed total contribution of the new diet need to be between these two. In the current implementation:\n\nminimum (lower bound) is 0.9 times of the total contribution\nmaximum (upper bound) is the same of the total contribution\nif we want to reduce ghge, then multiply a factor to the two values above.\n\nIn addition to the raw values, we also implement a standardized version for each of the tag_outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRationale for standardization\n\n\n\nWe wish to have roughly the same scale for different tag_outcomes. The current implementation takes the standard deviation across all foods for a specific tag (e.g. energy), then divide by this value. This is only ONE of the many ways to standardize for numerical stability.\nAlternatively, it is also possible to multiply a fixed constant such as 1000 to ghge. The interpretation could be better. As long the original diet vector is intact (meaning that the ratio between the original food 1, food 2 are unchanged), one can artificially modify the coefficients as they wish.\nHowever, it is important to keep consistency in the values and the inequality function!\n\n\n\ndemo_input &lt;- readRDS('data/demo_9foods_input.rda')\ndemo_input$current_diet\n\n       food_name intake_mean intake_lwr intake_upr\n1          Bread   188.31866  18.831866      343.8\n2     Vegetables    72.79364   7.279364      230.7\n3       Red meat   165.98669  16.598669      419.7\n4  Milk, yoghurt   184.13142  18.413142      552.7\n5           Fish   126.26154  12.626154      299.6\n6         Cheese    74.61885   7.461885      302.9\n7           Eggs    26.41185   2.641185      111.6\n8 Fruit, berries   328.64505  32.864505      900.6\n9       Potatoes    46.59652   4.659652      121.6\n\n\n\ndemo_input$unit_contrib\n\n       food_name    energy     protein       carbs         fat    vitaminc\n1          Bread 10.695553 0.091220068 0.441277081 0.030216648 0.005701254\n2     Vegetables  3.790560 0.020648968 0.178466077 0.007374631 0.132743363\n3       Red meat  1.565330 0.014877102 0.049805951 0.008408797 0.206985770\n4  Milk, yoghurt  2.728863 0.007580175 0.134110787 0.004081633 0.198250729\n5           Fish  8.341837 0.172619048 0.013605442 0.139455782 0.042517007\n6         Cheese  6.086331 0.169784173 0.024460432 0.074820144 0.000000000\n7           Eggs  6.178862 0.130081301 0.004065041 0.105691057 0.000000000\n8 Fruit, berries  1.979745 0.035935969 0.055864097 0.011107481 0.000000000\n9       Potatoes 13.502304 0.216589862 0.048387097 0.241935484 0.000000000\n     calcium    ghge\n1 0.33637400 0.00107\n2 0.08849558 0.00037\n3 0.25873221 0.00103\n4 0.15160350 0.00072\n5 0.11054422 0.01294\n6 0.24460432 0.00311\n7 0.52845529 0.00215\n8 1.28062725 0.00143\n9 6.58986175 0.01030\n\n\n\ndemo_constraints &lt;- readRDS('data/demo_9foods_constraints.rda')\ndemo_constraints\n\n  tag_outcome total_contrib_raw total_contrib_std    std_coef constr_min_std\n1      energy       6002.791497         1460.2828   0.2432673      1314.2545\n2     protein         82.349152         1034.1940  12.5586475       930.7746\n3       carbs        153.317587         1108.5790   7.2306054       997.7211\n4         fat         49.280653          606.6639  12.3103864       545.9975\n5    vitaminc         86.965858          976.6934  11.2307682       879.0241\n6     calcium        914.751986          434.7877   0.4753067       391.3090\n7        ghge          3.404557          736.7069 216.3885105       663.0362\n  cosntr_max_std constr_min_raw constr_max_raw\n1      1460.2828    5402.512347    6002.791497\n2      1034.1940      74.114237      82.349152\n3      1108.5790     137.985828     153.317587\n4       606.6639      44.352588      49.280653\n5       976.6934      78.269272      86.965858\n6       434.7877     823.276788     914.751986\n7       736.7069       3.064101       3.404557"

We have these values in the data: 175.4, 154.6, 117.6. In the function we use fd$intake to programmatically extract the values.\n\nfd$intake\n\n[1] 175.4 154.6 117.6\n\n# define objective \nobjective &lt;- function(x)\n{\n  return ( (x[1]- fd$intake[1])^2 + \n             (x[2]- fd$intake[2])^2 + \n             (x[3]- fd$intake[3])^2)\n}\n\n\n\nConstraints\nNow we define the inequality constraints. For this demo, we only include 3 metrics (energy, protein, ghge) for simplicity.\n\n# select the metrics we want to keep \nc3 &lt;- c3foods[, c('energy', 'protein', 'ghge')]\nc3\n\n      energy  protein    ghge\nlwr 2789.142 34.76268 1.67292\nupr 3099.047 38.62520 1.85880\n\n\nThe inequality constraints need to be reformulated for nloptr to work. More specifically, nloptr optimizes a function \\(f(x)\\) subject to a set of equality and inequality constraints. For the inequality constraints, they need to be the form of \\(g(x) &lt;= 0\\).\nWe write out our own constraints for energy:\n\\(x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 &gt;= E_{lower}, x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 &lt;= E_{upper}\\)\nThese two need to be re-written to be in the format of \\(g(x) &lt;= 0\\).\n\\(-(x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3)+E_{lower} &lt;= 0\\)\n\\(x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 - E_{upper} &lt;= 0\\)\nThe constraints for protein, ghge can be written in similar ways.\n\n# define the inequality constraints\ninequalconstr &lt;- function (x) {\n  constr &lt;- c(\n    # energy\n    - x[1]*fd$energy[1] - x[2]*fd$energy[2] - x[3]*fd$energy[3] + c3$energy[1], # lower\n    x[1]*fd$energy[1] + x[2]*fd$energy[2] + x[3]*fd$energy[3] - c3$energy[2], # upper\n    \n    # protein\n    - x[1]*fd$protein[1] - x[2]*fd$protein[2] - x[3]*fd$protein[3] + c3$protein[1],\n    x[1]*fd$protein[1] + x[2]*fd$protein[2] + x[3]*fd$protein[3] - c3$protein[2],\n\n    # ghge\n    - x[1]*fd$ghge[1] - x[2]*fd$ghge[2] - x[3]*fd$ghge[3]+ c3$ghge[1],\n    x[1]*fd$ghge[1] + x[2]*fd$ghge[2] + x[3]*fd$ghge[3] - c3$ghge[2]\n  )\n  return (constr)\n}\n\n\n\nOther options\nWe do not need to explicitly specify the non-negativity constraints for \\(x\\) inside the function. They are specified outside the function as a set of lower and upper bounds. You can set these range to be anything that make sense; for now we make it close to the current diet.\nInitial values are the values you tell the program to start the search. This is also up to you; sometimes initial values can have a large impact on the final results when the optimization problem is difficult (e.g. has multiple local optima). We can start close to the values of the current diet.\n\n# lower and upper bounds of x (3 foods)\nlb &lt;- c(160, 140, 100)\nub &lt;- c(180, 160, 120)\n\n# Initial values\n# (try different ones!)\nx0 &lt;- c(175, 150, 110) \n\nOptions should also be supplied to the program as a named list. These are specifications for the algorithm, tolerance and maximum evaluation. For more details please check the function manual.\nPay attention to the last line here: the size inside rep() need to match the number of inequality constraints. In this example it should be 6.\n\nopts &lt;- list( \"algorithm\" = \"NLOPT_GN_ISRES\",\n              \"xtol_rel\"= 1.0e-15,\n              \"maxeval\"= 160000,\n              \"tol_constraints_ineq\" = rep( 1.0e-10, 6 ))\n\nNow we run the optimization by calling nloptr from nloptr package. If you have loaded the package before, you don’t need the :: between the two.\nWe print the result and check the optimized values.\n\n# run the algorithm\nres &lt;- nloptr::nloptr(\n  x0          = x0,        # initial value for x\n  eval_f      = objective, # objective function\n  lb          = lb,        # lower bound for x\n  ub          = ub,        # upper bound for x\n  eval_g_ineq = inequalconstr, # inequality constraint\n  opts        = opts       # options\n  )\n\nprint(res)\n\n\nCall:\nnloptr::nloptr(x0 = x0, eval_f = objective, lb = lb, ub = ub, \n    eval_g_ineq = inequalconstr, opts = opts)\n\n\nMinimization using NLopt version 2.7.1 \n\nNLopt solver status: 4 ( NLOPT_XTOL_REACHED: Optimization stopped because \nxtol_rel or xtol_abs (above) was reached. )\n\nNumber of Iterations....: 36652 \nTermination conditions:  xtol_rel: 1e-15    maxeval: 160000 \nNumber of inequality constraints:  6 \nNumber of equality constraints:    0 \nOptimal value of objective function:  6.94702467573832e-26 \nOptimal value of controls: 175.4 154.6 117.6\n\n\nThe optimal values are 175.4, 154.6, 117.6. These are the same as the current diet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis result is not surprising; our current diet on the three foods already satisfies the constraints, and it is the closest to the current diet (\\((x_1 - X_1)^2 +(x_2 - X_2)^2 + (x_3 - X_3)^2 = 0\\)) when \\(x_1 = X_1, x_2 = X_2, x_3 = X_3\\)."

For the inequality constraints, they need to be the form of \\(g(x) &lt;= 0\\).\nWe write out our own constraints for energy:\n\\(x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 &gt;= E_{lower}, x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 &lt;= E_{upper}\\)\nThese two need to be re-written to be in the format of \\(g(x) &lt;= 0\\).\n\\(-(x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3)+E_{lower} &lt;= 0\\)\n\\(x_1 e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 - E_{upper} &lt;= 0\\)\nThe constraints for protein, ghge can be written in similar ways.\n\n# define the inequality constraints\ninequalconstr &lt;- function (x) {\n  constr &lt;- c(\n    # energy\n    - x[1]*fd$energy[1] - x[2]*fd$energy[2] - x[3]*fd$energy[3] + c3$energy[1], # lower\n    x[1]*fd$energy[1] + x[2]*fd$energy[2] + x[3]*fd$energy[3] - c3$energy[2], # upper\n    \n    # protein\n    - x[1]*fd$protein[1] - x[2]*fd$protein[2] - x[3]*fd$protein[3] + c3$protein[1],\n    x[1]*fd$protein[1] + x[2]*fd$protein[2] + x[3]*fd$protein[3] - c3$protein[2],\n\n    # ghge\n    - x[1]*fd$ghge[1] - x[2]*fd$ghge[2] - x[3]*fd$ghge[3]+ c3$ghge[1],\n    x[1]*fd$ghge[1] + x[2]*fd$ghge[2] + x[3]*fd$ghge[3] - c3$ghge[2]\n  )\n  return (constr)\n}\n\n\n\nOther options\nWe do not need to explicitly specify the non-negativity constraints for \\(x\\) inside the function. They are specified outside the function as a set of lower and upper bounds. You can set these range to be anything that make sense; for now we make it close to the current diet.\nInitial values are the values you tell the program to start the search. This is also up to you; sometimes initial values can have a large impact on the final results when the optimization problem is difficult (e.g. has multiple local optima). We can start close to the values of the current diet.\n\n# lower and upper bounds of x (3 foods)\nlb &lt;- c(160, 140, 100)\nub &lt;- c(180, 160, 120)\n\n# Initial values\n# (try different ones!)\nx0 &lt;- c(175, 150, 110) \n\nOptions should also be supplied to the program as a named list. These are specifications for the algorithm, tolerance and maximum evaluation. For more details please check the function manual.\nPay attention to the last line here: the size inside rep() need to match the number of inequality constraints. In this example it should be 6.\n\nopts &lt;- list( \"algorithm\" = \"NLOPT_GN_ISRES\",\n              \"xtol_rel\"= 1.0e-15,\n              \"maxeval\"= 160000,\n              \"tol_constraints_ineq\" = rep( 1.0e-10, 6 ))\n\nNow we run the optimization by calling nloptr from nloptr package. If you have loaded the package before, you don’t need the :: between the two.\nWe print the result and check the optimized values.\n\n# run the algorithm\nres &lt;- nloptr::nloptr(\n  x0          = x0,        # initial value for x\n  eval_f      = objective, # objective function\n  lb          = lb,        # lower bound for x\n  ub          = ub,        # upper bound for x\n  eval_g_ineq = inequalconstr, # inequality constraint\n  opts        = opts       # options\n  )\n\nprint(res)\n\n\nCall:\nnloptr::nloptr(x0 = x0, eval_f = objective, lb = lb, ub = ub, \n    eval_g_ineq = inequalconstr, opts = opts)\n\n\nMinimization using NLopt version 2.7.1 \n\nNLopt solver status: 4 ( NLOPT_XTOL_REACHED: Optimization stopped because \nxtol_rel or xtol_abs (above) was reached. )\n\nNumber of Iterations....: 38269 \nTermination conditions:  xtol_rel: 1e-15    maxeval: 160000 \nNumber of inequality constraints:  6 \nNumber of equality constraints:    0 \nOptimal value of objective function:  1.55500261637166e-26 \nOptimal value of controls: 175.4 154.6 117.6\n\n\nThe optimal values are 175.4, 154.6, 117.6. These are the same as the current diet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis result is not surprising; our current diet on the three foods already satisfies the constraints, and it is the closest to the current diet (\\((x_1 - X_1)^2 +(x_2 - X_2)^2 + (x_3 - X_3)^2 = 0\\)) when \\(x_1 = X_1, x_2 = X_2, x_3 = X_3\\)."

    "text": "How are constaints computed\n\nThe total contribution of a diet is a weighted sum of all food intake (diet, in gram) and contribution to this particular nutrition / environment impact outcome (tag_outcome). For instance, in total, the current diet of 188g bread and 165g red meat contributes to X1 units of energy; X2 units of ghge.\nThe current diet is the average for each food group among all subjects who we collected data from. The lwr, upr of the current are used to limit the search region for the new diet. In the current implementation, they are 5% and 95% quantiles from all the subject.\nThe inequality constraints (e.g. energy) requires two values: constr_min, constr_max. This means that the computed total contribution of the new diet need to be between these two. In the current implementation:\n\nminimum (lower bound) is 0.9 times of the total contribution\nmaximum (upper bound) is the same of the total contribution\nif we want to reduce ghge, then multiply a factor to the two values above.\n\nIn addition to the raw values, we also implement a standardized version for each of the tag_outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRationale for standardization\n\n\n\nWe wish to have roughly the same scale for different tag_outcomes. The current implementation takes the standard deviation across all foods for a specific tag (e.g. energy), then divide by this value. This is only ONE of the many ways to standardize for numerical stability.\nAlternatively, it is also possible to multiply a fixed constant such as 1000 to ghge. The interpretation could be better. As long the original diet vector is intact (meaning that the ratio between the original food 1, food 2 are unchanged), one can artificially modify the coefficients as they wish.\nHowever, it is important to keep consistency in the values and the inequality function!\n\n\n\ndemo_input &lt;- readRDS('data/demo_9foods_input.rda')\ndemo_input$current_diet\n\n       food_name intake_mean intake_lwr intake_upr\n1          Bread   188.31866  18.831866      343.8\n2     Vegetables    72.79364   7.279364      230.7\n3       Red meat   165.98669  16.598669      419.7\n4  Milk, yoghurt   184.13142  18.413142      552.7\n5           Fish   126.26154  12.626154      299.6\n6         Cheese    74.61885   7.461885      302.9\n7           Eggs    26.41185   2.641185      111.6\n8 Fruit, berries   328.64505  32.864505      900.6\n9       Potatoes    46.59652   4.659652      121.6\n\n\n\ndemo_input$unit_contrib\n\n       food_name    energy     protein       carbs         fat    vitaminc\n1          Bread 10.695553 0.091220068 0.441277081 0.030216648 0.005701254\n2     Vegetables  3.790560 0.020648968 0.178466077 0.007374631 0.132743363\n3       Red meat  1.565330 0.014877102 0.049805951 0.008408797 0.206985770\n4  Milk, yoghurt  2.728863 0.007580175 0.134110787 0.004081633 0.198250729\n5           Fish  8.341837 0.172619048 0.013605442 0.139455782 0.042517007\n6         Cheese  6.086331 0.169784173 0.024460432 0.074820144 0.000000000\n7           Eggs  6.178862 0.130081301 0.004065041 0.105691057 0.000000000\n8 Fruit, berries  1.979745 0.035935969 0.055864097 0.011107481 0.000000000\n9       Potatoes 13.502304 0.216589862 0.048387097 0.241935484 0.000000000\n     calcium    ghge\n1 0.33637400 0.00107\n2 0.08849558 0.00037\n3 0.25873221 0.00103\n4 0.15160350 0.00072\n5 0.11054422 0.01294\n6 0.24460432 0.00311\n7 0.52845529 0.00215\n8 1.28062725 0.00143\n9 6.58986175 0.01030\n\n\n\ndemo_constraints &lt;- readRDS('data/demo_9foods_constraints.rda')\ndemo_constraints\n\n  tag_outcome total_contrib_raw total_contrib_std    std_coef constr_min_std\n1      energy       6002.791497         1460.2828   0.2432673      1314.2545\n2     protein         82.349152         1034.1940  12.5586475       930.7746\n3       carbs        153.317587         1108.5790   7.2306054       997.7211\n4         fat         49.280653          606.6639  12.3103864       545.9975\n5    vitaminc         86.965858          976.6934  11.2307682       879.0241\n6     calcium        914.751986          434.7877   0.4753067       391.3090\n7        ghge          3.404557          736.7069 216.3885105       663.0362\n  cosntr_max_std constr_min_raw constr_max_raw\n1      1460.2828    5402.512347    6002.791497\n2      1034.1940      74.114237      82.349152\n3      1108.5790     137.985828     153.317587\n4       606.6639      44.352588      49.280653\n5       976.6934      78.269272      86.965858\n6       434.7877     823.276788     914.751986\n7       736.7069       3.064101       3.404557"

Also adding a file that includes the input files I’ve used for one of my analyses - I have copies of the same input files with some small changes made for each of the 4 diet scenarios I’ve run. Within each scenario there are 9 files that represent the different step-wise carbon footprint constraints (0%, -5%, -10%, -15%, -20%) etc. In each of these files you’ll find the code I ran for that specific iteration, along with the input data, nutrient constraints, nutrient reference values (for comparing results to), and realism constraints. Just adding these so you can see the way the data has been set up.\nOne important element in Rcplex is that the constraint matrix needs to have the same dimensions vertically and horizontally. So if there are 20 rows of nutrient constraints, there need to be 20 columns of nutrient input data, etc."
