The R package `noreden` provides user-friendly functions to facilitate sustainable diet discovery. Given information for food (groups) and their nutritional and environmental impact information, the aim is to find a new diet (i.e. set of foods) that is healthy, acceptable, yet more sustainable in terms of environmental impact.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://andreaczhang.github.io/noreden/) for noreden for more information. 

Introductory vignette can be read [here](https://andreaczhang.github.io/noreden/articles/noreden.html).
